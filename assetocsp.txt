Real Penalty - DRS lock when not allowed

Novedad
14 nov 2023

Thanks to the CSP extra options on the server and LUA script (doc here https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Misc-â€“-Server-extra-options), Real Penalty can now lock the DRS on the client when its use is not allowed.


Just set this option on your server:

[SCRIPT_0_RP_DRS]
SCRIPT = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadebolo/RealPenaltyLua/main/realpenalty"



It can only work using the CSP >= 0.1.76 on the client. Don't forget to set it as mandatory!



Important: don't set "Bonus Time" and "Max Illegal Uses" to zero, because the DRS could remain in any case open for a few milliseconds if the driver press the button.
